# MEAN_STACK_IMPLEMENTATION

I will be deploying a MEAN STACK to an ubuntu server

MEAN Stack is a combination of following components:
1. MongoDB (Document database) – Stores and allows to retrieve data.
2. Express (Back-end application framework) – Makes requests to Database for Reads and Writes.
3. Angular (Front-end application framework) – Handles Client and Server Requests
4. Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment) – Accepts requests and displays results to end user
